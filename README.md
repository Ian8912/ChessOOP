Object Oriented Programming GUI Chess Project

Created by: TXST students Ian Lingo, Pedro Perez, and Shaz Momin.

This project is a testament of our abilities and knowledge on Object Oriented Programming while being able to create a GUI in Java into a functional chess game from scratch. The program is split into 2 main packages "Game" and "Piece" as well as the "GameRun" class which runs the game. In order to run this project, you must have all files downloaded onto your device from our GitHub repository. Once you have done so, run the program from the GameRun.java file to pull up the chess game UI.

The chess pieces are all movable after pressing with your mouse and rotate the color pieces turn after every successful move. Once a player reaches to the other side of their opponents board, their piece will automatically promote into a Queen piece. A chess game is won after a player captures the opposing players King or vice versa and will close the program.
